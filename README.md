# Logistic-Regression-Model
Logistic Regression model to predict Airbnb superhosts using feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation techniques.
This project uses logistic regression to predict whether an Airbnb host is a superhost based on preprocessed Airbnb listing data. The model selection process includes:

Feature-target setup and dataset splitting

Training and evaluating a baseline logistic regression model

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Comparing model performance using ROC, AUC, and precision-recall curves

Selecting top features with SelectKBest

Saving and reloading the best-performing model using pickle

Tools used: Python, scikit-learn, seaborn, pandas, matplotlib
